## (1) Testing Local Streamlit Web Apps

This first section is an end-to-end bootcamp on **Streamlit**.

All applications will be deployed and tested as local Streamlit web apps. I’ll focus on the front-end architecture and walk over all possible Streamlit controls and components you need to know about, including data caching and the session state.

No connection to Snowflake yet, but we’ll continue to expand and deploy an exciting Hierarchical Data Viewer app on CSV tabular data, that will contain most elements of any data-driven application.

## (3) Connecting Streamlit Apps to Snowflake

I’ll introduce the different ways you can connect from Streamlit to Snowflake, including several specific examples on using each API:

* **SnowSQL** — with SQL script execution.
* **Snowflake Connector for Python** — with typical client applications.
* **Snowpark for Python** — with DataFrame API and stored proc decorators.
* **Streamlit Connector for Snowflake** — with secrets and login forms.

## (4) Deploying Streamlit Apps to Snowflake

We’ll focus on the two major brand new and revolutionary frameworks in Snowflake, deploying several Streamlit apps in each of them:

* **Streamlit in Snowflake Apps** — in your Snowflake account.
* **Snowflake Native Apps** — shared with other Snowflake accounts.
