# Data Analysis of Real-Estate Properties with a BI Streamlit App

Simplified version of the [**Analyzing real estate properties using Streamlit**](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/analyzing_real_estate_properties_with_streamlit/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) quickstart tutorial, using two Seaborn and Matplotlib charts.

**app.py** is the sumplified version of the original file from the *orig* folder. The **requirements.txt** file has no package versions. The dataset is the SV file from the *data* folder.

## Actions

Run **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** to install all new Python dependencies.

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run app.py`**. Quit the local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
