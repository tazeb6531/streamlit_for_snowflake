# Build a Complex Query with the Python Client and Snowpark

The **cte.py** file shows a SQL query with CTE executed directly with the Snowflake Connector for Python.

The **raw.py** file shows that when multiple SQL queries are executed the same way, they are all executed on the local machine.

## Actions

From the local subfolder, run from a Terminal window **`python cte.py`**, then  **`python raw.py`**.
