# Connect to Snowflake with SnowSQL CLI

Install and configure Snowflake's CLI client, [**SnowSQL**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql). Then execute SQL statements and scripts from this command line interface.

By the end, your Snowflake connection password will be saved in the *SNOWSQL_PWD* environment variable. And a [connections.demo_conn] section in the SnowSQL *config* file holds your Snowflake account name, and the user name.
