# Connect to Snowflake with Snowpark for Python

[**Snowpark for Python**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index) must be first installed with **`pip install snowflake-snowpark-python`**.

## Actions

From the local subfolder, run from a Terminal window: **`python app.py`**.

This assumes your Snowflake connection password was already saved in the *SNOWSQL_PWD* environment variable.
