# Create a Hierarchical Metadata Viewer as a Streamlit Multi-Page App

Build a multi-page Streamlit app connecting to Snowflake through a Snowpark session and using Snowflake metadata. The app will query the object dependencies from the OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES Account Usage view, and data lineage from the ACCESS_HISTORY view.

* [**How to Visualize the Data Lineage Graph in Snowflake**](https://medium.com/snowflake/how-to-visualize-the-data-lineage-graph-in-snowflake-f0a356046380)

## Files

* **1-create-scripts** - folder with SQL scripts to create test data in Snowflake. Must wait a while for the changes to propagate to the Account Usage views.
* **2-single-page-tabs/app.py** - single-page Streamlit app with the results appearing in different tabs. 
* **3-multi-page-old/app.py** - multi-page Streamlit app with a select box.
* **4-multi-page/Main.py** - multi-page Streamlit app with separate files in a *pages* subfolder. It also uses a separate **utils.py** file to get the Snowpark session.
* **requirements.txt** - external dependencies, for pip install.

## Actions

In separate SQL Worksheets in your Snowflake web UI, paste and run the two "create-scripts" and wait for the data to appear through the *Snowflake.Account_Usage* schema views.

Switch to the three subfolders with different versions of the new application, and run in a Terminal window either **`streamlit run app.py`**, or **`streamlit run Main.py`** (for the new multi-page version). Quit each local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
