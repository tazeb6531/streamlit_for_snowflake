# Complete the Hierarchical Data Viewer

Functionality has been split-up into separate modules, referenced from the top **app.py** file. Each view type will now be rendered into a different tab page. Each file format or chart type will be selected from a combo box.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run app.py`**. Quit the local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
