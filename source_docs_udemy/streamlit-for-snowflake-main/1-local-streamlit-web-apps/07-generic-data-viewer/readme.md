# Improve Original Data Viewer App and Make It More Generic

This simple version - with GraphViz only - will use input controls (i.e. Streamlit interactive widgets) to select any column as child or parent from the uploaded CSV file.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run app.py`**. Quit the local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
