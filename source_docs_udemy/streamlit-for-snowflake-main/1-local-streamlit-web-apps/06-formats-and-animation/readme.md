# Add Hierarchical Formats and Animation

Converts tabular hierarchical data into different semi-structured data formats: JSON, XML, YAML, including JSON with full path.

Renders hierarchical data with D3 animated charts. Some may use intermediary JSON data as input. Most charts here are based on a HTML template from the *animated/templates/* folder, and could save the generated HTML file in the *animated* folder.

## Actions

Run **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** to install all new Python dependencies.

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run formats.py`**, then **`streamlit run animation.py`**. You are supposed to be automatically redirected to a browser page, with your Streamlit app running as a local web app. Quit the session with CTRL+C from the Terminal.
