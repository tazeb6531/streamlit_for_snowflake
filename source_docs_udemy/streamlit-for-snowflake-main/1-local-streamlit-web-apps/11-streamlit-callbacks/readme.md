# Use Control Callbacks on Page Reruns

Extending the previous example, we use a **OnShowList** button callback function to stop processing if a specific CSV file has been uploaded.

The **buttons.py** file demonstrates the difference between a regular and a toggle button.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run app.py`**, then **`streamlit run buttons.py`**. Quit each local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
