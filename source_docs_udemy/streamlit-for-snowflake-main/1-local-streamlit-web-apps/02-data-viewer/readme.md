# Build a Simple Hierarchical Data Viewer in Python

This very simple hierarchical data viewer uses [**GraphViz**](https://graphviz.org/) - with a free [online visual editor](http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor) - to show a graph for all parent-child pair values loaded from a CSV file.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal: **`python app.py`**. You are supposed to be automatically redirected to a browser page, with the *Graphviz Visual Editor* showing your custom DOT code and graph.
