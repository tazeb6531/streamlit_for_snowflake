# Streamlit Layout Components

Uses a Streamlit tab control to render each Plotly chart into a separate tab page.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal: **`streamlit run app.py`**. You are supposed to be automatically redirected to a browser page, with your Streamlit app running as a local web app: the Plotly charts appear now one in each tab page, instead below each other. Quit the session with CTRL+C from the Terminal.
