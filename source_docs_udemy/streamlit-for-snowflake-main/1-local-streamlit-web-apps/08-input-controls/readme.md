# Use Streamlit Input Controls

This version will upload any CSV file, using a Streamlit *st.file_uploader* control. More test CSV files have been added to the *data* folder.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run app.py`**. Try uploading different CSV files. Quit the local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
