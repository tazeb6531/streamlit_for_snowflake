# Save State Data Between Page Reruns

The session state in Streamlit is a dictionary that can save data between page reruns. Here we use it to keep and display (in the sidebar) all names of loaded CSV files.

## Actions

From the current subfolder, run from a Terminal **`streamlit run app.py`**. Quit the local Streamlit web app session with CTRL+C.
