# Review the Snowflake Native App Framework

Presentation of the **Snowflake Native App Framework**, with the required steps to deploy an app in a provider account, and share it as a native app with a consumer. You may share it with private partner or customer accounts, or in the public Snowflake Marketplace.

Check also the [**Getting Started with Snowflake Native Apps**](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_native_apps/#0) quickstart tutorial, which uses a single Snowflake account to experience the app from the provider's perspective and from the consumer's perspective. Listing to the Snowflake Marketplace and versions/release directives are outside of the scope of the guide.
