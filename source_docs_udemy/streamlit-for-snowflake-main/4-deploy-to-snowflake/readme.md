# (4) Deploying Streamlit Apps to Snowflake

Python code can be deployed to Snowflake - and run directly in their virtual warehouses - as stored procs or UDFs, registered or deployed with Snowpark.

But whole Python web apps can be also deployed as STREAMLIT objects, as either Streamlit in Snowflake Apps, or as Snowflake Native Apps, shared with other consumer accounts.

This chapter is mostly about building, deploying or using Streamlit Apps and Native Apps in Snowflake.
